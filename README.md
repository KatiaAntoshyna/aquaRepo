it may be a web interface to control and change switches on arduino relays;
states is written just for me to imitate the relays;
it contain "1" + "1" if button is green and "0" if red for each button;
OK must save the states to a variable, that will be read by arduino;
RESET will discard changes on the buttons, recolors them according to states
